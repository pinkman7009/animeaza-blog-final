          Studio Ghibli’s films are undeniably the pinnacle of Japanese art.
          They portray a culture which respects hard work and acknowledges the
          inevitable struggles and challenges of mortal life, but also does not
          fail to capture the beauty in moments of stillness. The films touch
          upon real life topics with a touch of fantasy and has the power to
          leave the audience pondering things about themselves for days. Even
          though a few movies are targeted towards children, they do not attempt
          to gloss over struggles, pain, sickness or loneliness— all emotions
          inherent to human nature. Instead, they present what life is truly
          like through a medium of fantastical stories. Despite the fact that
          most Studio Ghibli movies lack a concrete “plot”, they show us that
          true art is found in the smallest pleasures and pains of life. What
          sets Studio Ghibli films apart from other anime films are their unique
          art style, simplicity, pacing and rawness of the characters that touch
          the audiences in a way that other films cannot.{' '}

          Overcoming obstacles and fulfilling dreams through hard work

        <p className={styles.paraText}>
          As mentioned above, Studio Ghibli movies are all about glamourizing
          the simplicities of life and with simplicity comes hard work since it
          is only through simplicity that one is able to understand the
          importance of hard work in life. This is a prominent theme in most
          Studio Ghibli films, portrayed either via physical labour, study or
          jobs. Posing an emphasis on the ideals of work ethic makes the films
          relatable to the audience while showing the value of hard work in
          Japanese culture.{' '}

        <p className={styles.paraText}>
          One such instance of work ethic and perseverance is shown in fourteen-
          year-old Shizuku Tsukishima in Whisper of the heart. After her meeting
          with Seiji—an aspiring violin player, Shizuku decides that it is not
          enough for her to simply spend her time reading stories all day and
          that she must do something and become someone to stand shoulder to
          shoulder to Seiji. Through inspiration from Seiji, she begins to think
          about her future and his perseverance drives her to start writing a
          story of her own. Studio Ghibli does not gloss over the struggle faced
          by Shizuku in her venture and does not shy away from showing the many
          sleepless nights, difficulty and anxiety that she has to endure. This
          raw portrayal makes her character relatable for the audience and they
          can tell how important this is for Shizuku. Although most films
          usually end by showing the reaps of hard work at the end, Whisper of
          the heart illustrates that hard work and perseverance is never-ending
          and that one should never stop the strive for betterment.{' '}

        <p className={styles.paraText}>
          Another fantastical film—Spirited Away, also demonstrates the
          importance of work ethic in Japanese culture. The main character
          Chihiro, a young girl who is shown to be sensitive and fearful in the
          beginning overcomes her fears and becomes strong through tough labour.
          With skilful animation, the film shows viewers what hard work looks
          and feels like through Chihiro’s struggles, and the painful scene of
          her accepting her fate while crying and eating rice balls.{' '}

        <p className={styles.paraText}>
          Like with Shizuku and Chihiro, most characters depicted in Studio
          Ghibli’s films are so realistic and raw that one can easily put
          themselves in the shoes of the character. For instance, in ‘When
          Marnie was there’, the main character Anna is presented as an
          introvert with Asthma who struggles to fit in. She searches for love
          and affection and years for company. Every emotion portrayed in the
          film is unembellished. The scene where Anna pokes a hole through her
          sketch book with her pencil while she saying “I hate myself” is a
          powerful demonstration of loss insecurity and depression that most
          people struggle with, at various points of their life. Despite the
          fact that it’s a rather strong and almost aggressive emotion, it’s one
          that many can relate to. Anna seeks what most do: family, friends,
          acceptance, love, and to be “normal”. What makes Anna’s story
          exceptionally touching is that she proves that even though there may
          be no scary villain or a ‘bad guy’, feelings of exclusion, self-
          hatred and depression can be even scarier than a tangible villain and
          overcoming them can be far more rewarding than slaying the evil
          dragon.

          Similarly, the character of Lady Eboshi from Princess Mononoke is a
          complex and interesting one. Lady Eboshi—the beautiful and headstrong
          leader of Iron Town appears to be a villain. But she isn't completely
          evil, though, unlike the majority of movie villains. Her character is
          not captured only via a black and white lens but a grey one. In fact,
          she has a soft spot for those who are oppressed, such as leapers and
          abused women. Unlike most villains, she isn't depicted as ugly but an
          elegant and respected woman. She is brave, beautiful, strong and
          almost raised to the standards of a character that the audience should
          look up to. While it may appear to be a contradiction, she is also a
          foe of the forest, plotting to destroy what belongs to the gods. The
          audience is perplexed as to whether she is ‘good’ or ‘bad’. She is
          evil in many ways: she ruthlessly cuts the forest and seeks to
          assassinate the forest gods. So, why then is she so adored and
          revered? The answer is straightforward: she is a human being with both
          positive and negative characteristics. Lady Eboshi seeks to remind
          viewers that humans are flawed, and no person can be all good or all
          bad but a concoction of both. Miyazaki is also celebrated for his
          realistic portrayals of women in his films. Almost all of Miyazaki’s
          films have women as the main characters and they are always portrayed
          realistically, in all of their raw, unembellished glory.{' '}

          The beauty found within everyday moments of stillness
        </p>

        <Image src='/4.jpg' width={800} height={500} />

        <p className={styles.paraText}>
          One of the most important contributing factors of what makes Studio
          Ghibli films and its characters so realistic and developed and is the
          length of Studio Ghibli movies. By animation standards, these films
          are quite lengthy. Studio Ghibli films often present scenes that do
          not inherently add anything to the plotline: simple moments of
          stillness, or slow sequences with little action or words. While these
          scenes may seem irrelevant, they are exactly the elements that elevate
          the experience of watching a Studio Ghibli film. These moments almost
          humanize the characters and heighten their emotions of isolation,
          wonder or sadness. It is through these moments of stillness that the
          viewers can connect with the characters and understand their feelings.
          These apparently mundane scenes emphasise the importance of stillness
          in today's fast-paced world and the beauty of a slow-paced life.

          Recalling his conversation with Hayao Miyazaki, Robert Ebert muses—"I
          love the “gratuitous motion” in his films, instead of every movement
          being dictated by the story, sometimes people will just sit for a
          moment or they will sigh, or look in a running stream, or do something
          extra, not to advance the story but only to give the sense of time and
          place and who they are. “We have a word for that in Japanese”,
          Miyazaki said. “It’s called ‘ma’. Emptiness. It’s there
          intentionally.” Is that like the “pillow words” that separate phrases
          in Japanese poetry? “I don’t think it’s like the pillow word.” He
          clapped his hands three or four times. “The time in between my
          clapping is ma. If you just have non-stop action with no breathing
          space at all, it’s just busyness. But if you take a moment, then the
          tension building in the film can grow into a wider dimension. If you
          just have constant at 80 degrees all the time you just get numb.”{' '}
